<h2>Abstract</h2>

<font size="2">
		High-quality realistic rendering of hair and fur is a long-standing goal in computer graphics. It includes a number of challenges, such as computation of accurate light scattering for individual fibres and handling the complex geometry of hair volume. Physically based approach in rendering hair is aims to achieve plausible result; however, its drawback is the lack of artist friendly controls.
		
In this paper we present an implementation of a user-friendly hair reflectance model in Houdini based on proposals in (Chiang et al., 2016) and (Yan et al., 2017), who constructed physically based hair and fur shading models. The results of these approaches are illustrated in numerous renderings. All images were rendered using the physically plausible pipeline in Mantra.
